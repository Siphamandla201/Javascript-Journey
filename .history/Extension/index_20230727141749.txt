This code is a simple example of a browser extension that allows users to save URLs to a list and open them in new tabs. It uses localStorage to store the leads so that they persist even when the browser is closed and reopened.
 The render function is responsible for displaying the leads as clickable links in an unordered list on the webpage.
The tabBtn element's click event listener uses the Chrome API to get the currently active tab's URL and adds it to the leads list. The deleteBtn element's double-click event listener clears the stored leads and resets the myLeads array. Finally, the inputBtn element's click event listener takes the input value from inputEl, adds it to the leads list, and updates the display.
