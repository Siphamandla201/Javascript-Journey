This code sets up a counting app using two buttons and two HTML elements with IDs "save-el" and "count-el." The increment function increases the count by 1 and updates the displayed count value in the "count-el" element. The save function appends the current count value with a hyphen and space to the content of the "save-el" element and then resets the count to 0
