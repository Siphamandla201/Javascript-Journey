This code is a simple Blackjack game implemented in JavaScript. It defines a player object with a name and chips, and initializes variables to keep track of the game state, such as cards, sum, hasBlackJack, and isAlive.



The getRandomCard() function generates a random card value between 1 and 11.

Math.random() is a JavaScript function that returns a random floating-point number between 0 1. 

The startGame() function is used to begin the game, drawing two initial cards for the player. The renderGame() function updates the HTML elements to display the current game state, including the player's cards and the sum of their values. It also determines the message to be displayed based on the sum, indicating whether the player can draw a new card or if they have won or lost.

The newCard() function allows the player to draw a new card if they are still alive (sum <= 21) and have not yet achieved Blackjack. The new card's value is added to the sum, and the game state is updated.

The code uses DOM manipulation to display the game information on the webpage by updating the text content of specific elements with the textContent property.
